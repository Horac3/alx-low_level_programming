Bit manipulation refers to the process of manipulating individual bits or groups of bits within a binary number. In C, you can use bitwise operators to perform bit manipulation.

The bitwise operators in C are:

"&" (bitwise AND)
"|" (bitwise OR)
"^" (bitwise XOR)
"~" (bitwise NOT)
"<<" (left shift)
">>" (right shift)
The bitwise AND operator returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. The bitwise OR operator returns a 1 in each bit position for which at least one of the corresponding bits of either but not both operands is 1. The bitwise XOR operator returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1. The bitwise NOT operator returns the complement of the operand (i.e., it changes every 0 to a 1 and every 1 to a 0).

The left shift operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand. The right shift operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand.

These operators can be used to perform various bit manipulation tasks, such as setting or clearing individual bits, extracting bits from a number, or combining bits from multiple numbers.
