In C, a file is a collection of data that's stored on a computer. The data in a file can be anything, like text, numbers, or even pictures. We use file input/output (I/O) in C to read from or write to these files.

To read from a file in C, we use a function called "fscanf". This function lets us read in data from a file and store it in a variable in our program. For example, if we have a file with a bunch of numbers on each line, we can use "fscanf" to read in each line and store it in an array.

To write to a file in C, we use a function called "fprintf". This function lets us write data to a file from our program. For example, if we want to write out some data to a file, like a list of people's names and ages, we can use "fprintf" to write that data to a file.

Before we can use file I/O in C, we need to open the file first. We use the "fopen" function to do this. This function takes two arguments: the name of the file we want to open, and the mode we want to open it in (like read-only or write-only).

When we're done with a file, we need to close it using the "fclose" function. This function lets the computer know that we're done using the file and it can be safely saved to disk.

That's a basic overview of file I/O in C!
